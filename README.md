#GraphBox

This is my first course project, so please don't judge me too harshly. Although the grouping of files leaves much to be desired, however, you may like the functionality of the program.
The program was made using Delphi.

##Main idea

<p> This program allows you to build flowcharts according to the Damke principle. This is a special type of schema that can be used to build only program schemas that correspond to the concept of structured programming. The principle is that the blocks on the right reveal the content of the blocks on the left.</p>

##Features

The project was inspired by programs such as Visio and Draw.io . However, it is much more difficult to draw flowcharts of this type with their help. This program is much more narrowly focused, but it provides interesting solutions in its field.

- Automatic placement of blocks. You just need to drag the block onto the diagram, and it will automatically get into the desired position.
- Automatic line drawing. This was the greatest difficulty when creating flowcharts using other programs.
- The ability to drag groups of blocks. Dragging one block, all the blocks below will be dragged along with it.
- Working with multiple files
- Working with multiple flowcharts within a single file
- Deleting blocks
- Canceling the last action (the last 20 actions are remembered)
- Ctrl-C to copy an image as a PNG image
- Saving a flowchart to a custom file format

##Installation

For a convenient installation, an installer with the ability to select various parameters was made.
